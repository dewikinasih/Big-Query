# 1. Analysis of Retail Dataset
Imagine the manager would like to know about our business, then she asked me to discover trends, predict outcomes, and make better, more profitable business decisions. 

I used the look ecommerce dataset provided by  Big Query public data. This dataset contains 7 tables but I just want to used orders, order_items,  users, and products table to answer some of business question that I formulated before.

I have been summarized the result :
- We have significant growth in our business comparing to last year. All products category has the higher revenue in 2022 with the highest growth in dresses category and the lowest growth in jacket and blazer. This year, we got the most revenue from outerwear category and the lowest revenue from clothing set category
-	Guangdong, England, and California are the state with the highest revenue and also the higest total order.  Whereas Fukushima, Okayama, and Miyagi has the lowest revenue and least number or order.
-	Outerwear and Coats woulfd likely bring us the most revenue, whereas jeans would bring us the most customers.
-	in 2 years the revenue always  drop slightly in April but in 2022 the drop was extremely farther than 2021. December always gives us the highest revenue
